    "# 1. COVARIATE SHIFT Issue:\n",
    "Covariate shift is a problem in machine learning where the distribution of input features (covariates) in the training and \n",
    "testing datasets is different. It affects model performance because a model trained on one distribution may not generalize \n",
    "well to another distribution. To address this issue, techniques like importance re-weighting and domain adaptation are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Batch Normalization:\n",
    "Batch normalization is a technique used in neural networks to stabilize and speed up training. It normalizes the input of \n",
    "each layer within a mini-batch, making it have zero mean and unit variance. This helps in mitigating issues like\n",
    "vanishing/exploding gradients and accelerates convergence during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. LeNet Architecture:\n",
    "LeNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture used for image recognition. It consists of several layers, \n",
    "including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolution and pooling layers help in\n",
    "feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, while fully connected layers perform classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Vanishing Gradient Problem:\n",
    "The vanishing gradient problem occurs during training deep neural networks when the gradients of the loss function with\n",
    "respect to the models parameters become very small. As a result, the networks weights are hardly updated, leading to\n",
    "slow convergence or getting stuck. It is especially problematic in deep networks with many layers, like recurrent neural\n",
    "networks (RNNs) and deep feedforward networks.\n",

    "# 6. Normalization of Local Response:\n",
    "Normalization of Local Response, or Local Response Normalization (LRN), is a technique used in neural networks, often in\n",
    "convolutional layers, to enhance the response of certain neurons while suppressing others. It helps in creating competition\n",
    "among neurons and improving the networks ability to generalize. Its more commonly used in architectures like AlexNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Weight Regularization in AlexNet:\n",
    "AlexNet uses dropout as a weight regularization technique. Dropout randomly drops out a fraction of neurons during\n",
    "training, which prevents overfitting by making the network more robust and less reliant on individual neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. VGGNet Configurations:\n",
    "VGGNet has different configurations denoted by VGG-XX, where XX represents the number of layers. Common configurations\n",
    "include VGG-16 and VGG-19, with 16 and 19 weight layers, respectively. These configurations are deeper and achieve better\n",
    "performance on image classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. Regularization in VGGNet:\n",
    "VGGNet primarily uses dropout and weight decay (L2 regularization) to prevent overfitting. Dropout is applied to fully \n",
    "connected layers, and weight decay helps control the magnitude of weight values, preventing them from becoming too large \n",
    "and leading to overfitting."
