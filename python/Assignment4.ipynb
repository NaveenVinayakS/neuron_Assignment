    "Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. To support iteration in your classes, you can overload the __iter__ and __next__ methods. The __iter__ method should return an iterator object, and the __next__ method should define the logic to retrieve the next item in the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?\n",
    "\n",
    "A2. The __str__ and __repr__ methods are used for managing printing and displaying an object's representation. __str__ is called by the str() function and during string formatting with str.format(). __repr__ is called by the repr() function and when an object is displayed in the interactive interpreter.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "A3. You can intercept slice operations by implementing the __getitem__ method with appropriate logic to handle slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?\n",
    "\n",
    "A4. To capture in-place addition, you can overload the __iadd__ method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?\n",
    "\n",
    "A5. Operator overloading is appropriate when you want to define custom behavior for built-in operators in your classes. Common use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating user-friendly and intuitive class interfaces.\n",
    "Implementing mathematical operations for custom data types.\n",
    "Defining custom comparison logic for sorting and equality checks.\n",
    "Customizing container types (e.g., lists, dictionaries) for specific behaviors."
