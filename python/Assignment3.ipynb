    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass is a class that is designed to be inherited by other classes but cannot be instantiated itself. It typically defines a blueprint for its subclasses, including method signatures that must be implemented by the subclasses. Python provides an abc module for creating abstract base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class AbstractSuperclass(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def abstract_method(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Subclass(AbstractSuperclass):\n",
    "    def abstract_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Implemented abstract method in Subclass\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attempting to create an instance of AbstractSuperclass will result in an error.\n",
    "# abstract_instance = AbstractSuperclass()  # This will raise a TypeError.\n",
    "subclass_instance = Subclass()\n",
    "subclass_instance.abstract_method()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "When an assignment statement is placed at the top level of a class statement (outside of any methods), it creates a class-level variable, which is shared among all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    class_variable = 10  # This is a class-level variable shared among instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, instance_variable):\n",
    "        self.instance_variable = instance_variable\n",
    "\n",
    "obj1 = MyClass(20)\n",
    "obj2 = MyClass(30)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(obj1.class_variable)  # Output: 10\n",
    "print(obj2.class_variable)  # Output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "obj1.class_variable = 50  # This creates an instance-specific class_variable for obj1.\n",
    "print(obj1.class_variable)  # Output: 50\n",
    "print(obj2.class_variable)  # Output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's __init__ method?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when a subclass defines its own __init__ method, it does not automatically call the superclass's __init__ method. To ensure that the superclass's initialization code is executed, you need to explicitly call the superclass's __init__ method using super().\n",
    "\n",
    "class ParentClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Call the superclass's __init__ method\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "child = ChildClass(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
    "print(child.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(child.age)   # Output: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can augment an inherited method by calling the superclass's method using super() and then adding or modifying behavior in the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "class ParentClass:\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"ParentClass method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        super().method()  # Call the superclass's method\n",
    "        print(\"Additional behavior in ChildClass\")\n",
    "\n",
    "child = ChildClass()\n",
    "child.method()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The local scope of a class and a function is different in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a class, variables declared within methods are instance variables and belong to the object's state. They are accessible via self and are unique to each instance.\n",
    "In a function, variables declared within the function are local to that function and cannot be directly accessed from outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    class_variable = 10  # Class-level variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, instance_variable):\n",
    "        self.instance_variable = instance_variable  # Instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    local_variable = 20  # Local variable within the function\n",
    "    print(local_variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass(30)\n",
    "print(obj.instance_variable)  # Accessing instance variable\n",
    "print(obj.class_variable)     # Accessing class-level variable\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()  # Calling the function\n"
