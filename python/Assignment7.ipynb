    "# 1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "The re module in Python is responsible for generating Regex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw strings (e.g., r'some_pattern') are often used in Regex objects to ensure that backslashes in the pattern are treated\n",
    "as literal characters and not as escape sequences. This is important in regular expressions because backslashes are often \n",
    "used to escape special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "The search() method returns a match object if a match is found, or None if no match is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. From a Match object, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "You can use the group() method of the match object to retrieve the actual strings that match the pattern.\n",
    "For example, match.group(0) returns the entire matched string.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. In the regex created from r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "Group 0 covers the entire matched string. Group 2 covers the part matched by (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d), and Group 1 covers the \n",
    "part matched by (\\d\\d\\d).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to match real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "To match real parentheses and periods in a regex, you can escape them using a backslash. For example, to match a literal\n",
    "period, you would use \\. in your regex pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "The findall() method returns a list of string tuples when the regular expression contains more than one capturing group.\n",
    "If there is only one capturing group, it returns a list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. In regular expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "The | character in a regular expression represents the logical OR operator. It is used to specify alternative patterns.\n",
    "For example, pattern1|pattern2 matches either pattern1 or pattern2.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. In regular expressions, what does the + character stand for?\n",
    "In regular expressions, the + character means \"one or more\" of the preceding element. For example, a+ matches one or more \n",
    "occurrences of the character 'a'.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "The + character matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element, while the * character matches zero or more \n",
    "occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expressions?\n",
    "{4} matches exactly 4 occurrences of the preceding element. {4,5} matches between 4 and 5 occurrences of the preceding \n",
    "element.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. What do the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\\d matches any digit (equivalent to [0-9]).\n",
    "\\w matches any word character (letters, digits, or underscores).\n",
    "\\s matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, newlines).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. What do \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\\D matches any non-digit character (equivalent to [^0-9]).\n",
    "\\W matches any non-word character.\n",
    "\\S matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    ".*? is a non-greedy or lazy quantifier that matches as few characters as possible. .* is a greedy quantifier that matches as many characters as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "You can use [0-9a-z] to match both numbers and lowercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16. What is the procedure for making a regular expression case insensitive?\n",
    "You can make a regular expression case insensitive by using the re.IGNORECASE flag when compiling the regex pattern with \n",
    "re.compile(), or by using (?i) inside the pattern itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as the 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "The . character normally matches any character except a newline. If re.DOTALL (or re.S) is passed as the 2nd argument in\n",
    "re.compile(), it will also match a newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numReg.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hens') return?\n",
    "numReg.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hens') will return the string \n",
    "'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow you to do?\n",
    "Passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allows you to write regular expressions with whitespace and comments\n",
    "for better readability. It ignores whitespace and comments within the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 20. How would you write a regex that matches a number with commas for every three digits?\n",
    "You can use the regex pattern: r'\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*' to match a number with commas for every three digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe?\n",
    "You can use the regex pattern: r'[A-Z][a-z]*\\sWatanabe' to match the full name of someone whose last name is \"Watanabe.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence with specific words and ends with a period in a case-insensitive manner?\n",
    "You can use the regex pattern: r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\\s(eats|pets|throws)\\s(apples|cats|baseballs)\\.' with the re.IGNORECASE flag to make it case-insensitive."
