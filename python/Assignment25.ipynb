    "# 1 What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "Square brackets [] are used to create a list comprehension, which generates a new list. Parentheses () are used to create a generator expression, which produces an iterator. The key differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehension creates a list and stores all the elements in memory at once, while a generator expression produces elements on-the-fly and doesn't store them in memory.\n",
    "List comprehensions are generally faster for small collections, while generator expressions are more memory-efficient and suitable for large collections.\n",
    "You can iterate through a list comprehension multiple times, while a generator expression can only be iterated through once (unless recreated)."
