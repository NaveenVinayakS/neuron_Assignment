    "#Q1. Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results at runtime?\n",
    "The assignment operator += is not just for show; it is a useful operator in Python. It is used to increment the value of a\n",
    "variable by a certain amount. In some cases, using += can lead to faster results at runtime compared to manually\n",
    "reassigning values to a variable. This is because += can be more efficient in terms of memory and performance, as \n",
    "it can update the value in place without creating a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2. What is the smallest number of statements you'd have to write in most programming languages to replace the Python expression a, b = a + b, a?\n",
    "In most programming languages, you would need three statements to replace the Python expression a, b = a + b, a\n",
    "\n",
    "a, b = a + b, a\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. In Python, what is the most effective way to set a list of 100 integers to 0?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective way to initialize a list of 100 integers to 0 in Python\n",
    "my_list = [0] * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. What is the most effective way to initialize a list of 99 integers that repeats the sequence 1, 2, 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize a list of 99 integers that repeats the sequence 1, 2, 3, you can use a list comprehension with\n",
    "the itertools.cycle function:\n",
    "    \n",
    "from itertools import cycle, islice\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = list(islice(cycle([1, 2, 3]), 99))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. If you're using IDLE to run a Python application, explain how to print a multidimensional list efficiently?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can efficiently print a multidimensional list in IDLE by using a nested loop to iterate through the rows and columns \n",
    "of the list and then printing each element. \n",
    "my_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "\n",
    "for row in my_list:\n",
    "    for element in row:\n",
    "        print(element, end='\\t')\n",
    "    print()  # Move to the next line after printing each row\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q6. Is it possible to use list comprehension with a string? If so, how can you go about doing it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, its possible to use list comprehension with a string in Python. You can use list comprehension to create a list of \n",
    "characters from a string\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "char_list = [char for char in my_string]\n",
    "print(char_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q7. From the command line, how do you get support with a user-written Python program? Is this possible from inside IDLE?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get support for a user-written Python program from the command line by running the Python program with the\n",
    "-h or --help option, which is often used to display help information or command-line options if the program includes\n",
    "such functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q8. Functions are said to be \"first-class objects\" in Python but not in most other languages, such as C++ or Java. What can you do in Python with a function (callable object) that you can't do in C or C++?\n",
    "In Python, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be treated like any other object (e.g., integers, strings, lists). This allows you to do several things with functions that you can't do in languages like C or C++:\n",
    "Functions can be assigned to variables: You can assign a function to a variable and pass it around as an argument to other functions.\n",
    "Functions can be elements of data structures: You can store functions in data structures like lists, dictionaries, or sets.\n",
    "Functions can be passed as arguments: You can pass functions as arguments to other functions, which is commonly used in functional programming and callbacks.\n",
    "Functions can be returned from other functions: Functions can return other functions as their results, enabling the creation of higher-order functions.\n",
    "Functions can be defined inside other functions: You can define functions within other functions, creating closures.\n",
    "You can create anonymous functions (lambda functions): Python allows you to define anonymous functions using lambda, which is not as flexible or expressive in C or C++.\n",
    "These features make Python more versatile in terms of function manipulation and make it easier to implement certain programming paradigms like functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q9. How do you distinguish between a wrapper, a wrapped feature, and a decorator?\n",
    "In the context of programming and Python:\n",
    "Wrapper: A wrapper is a function or piece of code that surrounds or encapsulates another function or object. It is used to modify the behavior of the wrapped feature or add some functionality around it. Wrappers are often used in the context of design patterns like the Decorator pattern.\n",
    "Wrapped Feature: The wrapped feature is the core functionality or object that is being encapsulated or modified by the wrapper. It's the original function or component that you want to enhance or alter.\n",
    "Decorator: A decorator is a design pattern in Python that is used to add new functionality to an existing object or function without modifying its structure. Decorators are typically implemented using Python functions and the @ symbol. They are a common way to wrap features with other functions, enhancing or modifying their behavior.\n",
    "In summary, a wrapper is the code that surrounds and modifies a wrapped feature, and a decorator is a specific type of wrapper used to enhance or modify functions or methods in a flexible and reusable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q10. If a function is a generator function, what does it return?\n",
    "A generator function in Python uses the yield keyword to yield values one at a time instead of returning them all at once. When you call a generator function, it returns a generator object. You can then iterate over this generator object using a loop or by explicitly calling next() to obtain the values produced by the yield statements."
