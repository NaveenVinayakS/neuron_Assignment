    "# Q1. If you have any, what are your choices for increasing the comparison between different figures on the same graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: To increase the comparison between different figures on the same graph, you can consider using the following \n",
    "    techniques:\n",
    "a. Use different colors for each figure or data series.\n",
    "b. Add a legend to the graph to label each figure.\n",
    "c. Use different line styles or marker styles for each figure.\n",
    "d. Adjust the transparency (alpha) of the figures to make them partially transparent.\n",
    "e. Place the figures on the same scale or use dual axes if the data scales are significantly different.\n",
    "f. Utilize annotations and labels to highlight key points or differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Can you explain the benefit of compound interest over a higher rate of interest that does not compound after reading this chapter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Compound interest is advantageous over a higher rate of interest that does not compound because it allows your \n",
    "    money to grow at an accelerated rate. The key benefits of compound interest include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Earning interest on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest, leading to exponential growth.\n",
    "Increasing your wealth over time, especially when you reinvest the interest.\n",
    "Maximizing the long-term return on your investments.\n",
    "Capitalizing on the time value of money, which means your money's value increases with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. What is a histogram, exactly? Name a numpy method for creating such a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It displays the frequency or count of\n",
    "    data points within predefined intervals or bins. Numpy provides a method called numpy.histogram for creating histograms\n",
    "    \n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "data = np.random.randn(1000)  # Example data\n",
    "hist, bins = np.histogram(data, bins=10)  # Create a histogram\n",
    "plt.hist(data, bins=10, alpha=0.5, color='b', edgecolor='black')  # Plot the histogram\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. If necessary, how do you change the aspect ratios between the X and Y axes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: To change the aspect ratio between the X and Y axes in a matplotlib plot, you can use the aspect parameter when\n",
    "    setting up the plot. \n",
    "    \n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a sample plot\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "y = [10, 20, 15, 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Change the aspect ratio\n",
    "plt.gca().set_aspect('equal')  # Use 'equal' for a 1:1 aspect ratio\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Compare and contrast the three types of array multiplication between two numpy arrays: dot product, outer product, and regular multiplication of two numpy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In numpy, the three types of array multiplication are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dot Product (Matrix Multiplication):\n",
    "\n",
    "Performed using numpy.dot or @ operator.\n",
    "Results in a scalar or a matrix, depending on the dimensions of the input arrays.\n",
    "Used for linear transformations, inner products, and matrix operations.\n",
    "Requires the inner dimensions to match (e.g., (m, n) dot (n, p) results in an (m, p) matrix).\n",
    "Outer Product:\n",
    "\n",
    "Performed using numpy.outer.\n",
    "Results in a matrix that combines elements of the input arrays.\n",
    "Produces a result of shape (m, n) from input arrays of shape (m,) and (n,).\n",
    "Useful for calculating all possible pairwise products between elements of two arrays.\n",
    "Regular Element-Wise Multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "Performed using the * operator or numpy.multiply.\n",
    "Multiplies corresponding elements of two arrays element-wise.\n",
    "The result has the same shape as the input arrays.\n",
    "Used for element-wise operations, such as scaling or component-wise interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. Before you buy a home, which numpy function will you use to measure your monthly mortgage payment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: To calculate your monthly mortgage payment before buying a home, you can use the numpy.pmt function, which stands\n",
    "    for \"Payment.\" This function calculates the fixed monthly payment required to fully repay a loan, including both the \n",
    "    principal and interest, over a specified number of periods.\n",
    "    \n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loan parameters\n",
    "loan_amount = 200000  # Principal loan amount\n",
    "annual_interest_rate = 0.05  # Annual interest rate (5%)\n",
    "loan_term_years = 30  # Loan term in years\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate monthly mortgage payment\n",
    "monthly_interest_rate = annual_interest_rate / 12\n",
    "loan_term_months = loan_term_years * 12\n",
    "monthly_payment = np.pmt(monthly_interest_rate, loan_term_months, -loan_amount)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Your monthly mortgage payment is: ${monthly_payment:.2f}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. Can string data be stored in numpy arrays? If so, list at least one restriction that applies to this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Yes, string data can be stored in numpy arrays using the numpy.array data type dtype='str' or dtype='object'.\n",
    "    However, there are some restrictions to be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed-Length Strings: By default, numpy arrays store strings as fixed-length, which means all strings in the array have \n",
    "    the same length. If you try to store variable-length strings (strings of different lengths), they will be truncated or\n",
    "    padded with whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Overhead: Storing strings as objects or with dtype='str' can lead to performance overhead and increased memory\n",
    "    usage compared to storing numerical data. Numpy arrays are more efficient when dealing with homogeneous numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited String Operations: Numpy arrays dont offer the same level of string manipulation and operations as Python's \n",
    "    built-in string functions or libraries like str methods. If you need extensive string operations, consider using a \n",
    "    dedicated data structure or library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Type Considerations: When using dtype='object' to store strings, the array becomes a generic object array, making it\n",
    "    less suitable for numerical computations and potentially losing some of the benefits of numpys array operations."
