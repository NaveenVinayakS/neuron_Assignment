    "#Q1. What is the distinction between a numpy array and a pandas data frame? Is there a way to convert between the two if there is?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames are both data structures commonly used in Python for data manipulation, but they\n",
    "    have some key differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy Array:\n",
    "Numpy arrays are homogeneous, meaning they store elements of the same data type.\n",
    "They are mainly used for numerical and mathematical operations.\n",
    "Numpy arrays are more memory-efficient and faster for numerical computations.\n",
    "Pandas DataFrame:\n",
    "Pandas DataFrames are heterogeneous, allowing for different data types in each column.\n",
    "They are used for working with structured data and are ideal for data analysis and manipulation.\n",
    "Pandas DataFrames provide powerful data indexing and manipulation features.\n",
    "To convert between the two, you can use the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a Pandas DataFrame to a Numpy array: df.to_numpy() or df.values.\n",
    "To convert a Numpy array to a Pandas DataFrame: pd.DataFrame(array), where pd is the Pandas library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2. What can go wrong when a user enters a stock-ticker symbol, and how do you handle it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Several issues can arise when a user enters a stock-ticker symbol:\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorrect Ticker Symbol: Users might enter a ticker symbol that doesnt exist or is misspelled. To handle this, you can\n",
    "    validate the symbol against a reliable data source or API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing Data: Some ticker symbols might not have available data for the specified time frame. In this case, you should \n",
    "    provide appropriate error handling and user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Format Issues: Users may input data in an incorrect format or with extra characters. Proper input validation and \n",
    "    formatting are essential to prevent issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Errors: If youre using an API to fetch stock data, it may experience downtime or rate limits. Implement error handling\n",
    "    and retries for such situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling these issues involves input validation, error handling, and providing clear feedback to the user when errors \n",
    "occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3. Identify some of the plotting techniques that are used to produce a stock-market chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Stock-market charts can be created using various plotting techniques. Some common ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Line Charts: Line charts are used to display the price or performance of a stock over time. They are straightforward and \n",
    "    can show trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Candlestick Charts: Candlestick charts display open, close, high, and low prices for a stock within a specific time period,\n",
    "    providing a more detailed view of price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "OHLC Charts: OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) charts are similar to candlestick charts but provide a simple bar representation\n",
    "    for each time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving Averages: Plotting moving averages, such as the 50-day or 200-day moving average, can help identify trends and \n",
    "    support/resistance levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volume Charts: Volume charts show the trading volume for a stock, helping to analyze the liquidity and interest in a\n",
    "    particular stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands combine a moving average with volatility bands to visualize potential price volatility and\n",
    "    reversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSI (Relative Strength Index) Charts: RSI charts help identify overbought or oversold conditions, indicating potential\n",
    "    trend reversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4. Why is it essential to print a legend on a stock market chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Printing a legend on a stock market chart is essential for clarity and understanding. A legend provides labels for\n",
    "    the various elements on the chart, helping viewers interpret the information. In the context of a stock market chart, \n",
    "    the legend typically explains what each line, color, or symbol represents. The importance of a legend includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear Interpretation: Without a legend, viewers may struggle to understand which line or data series corresponds to which \n",
    "    stock or data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Context: A legend provides context for the chart, ensuring that viewers can make informed decisions based on the \n",
    "    displayed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Confusion: Stock charts often include multiple stocks, indices, or indicators. A legend prevents confusion by \n",
    "    clearly indicating which is which.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional Presentation: Including a legend enhances the professionalism and readability of the chart, making it more\n",
    "    accessible to a wider audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q5. What is the best way to limit the length of a Pandas DataFrame to less than a year?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: To limit the length of a Pandas DataFrame to less than a year, you can filter the data based on the date or time.\n",
    "    Assuming your DataFrame has a date column\n",
    "    \n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming 'date_column' is the name of your date column\n",
    "# and 'df' is your DataFrame\n",
    "\n",

    "# Calculate the start date by subtracting one year from the end date\n",
    "start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=365)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filter the DataFrame to include only data within the past year\n",
    "filtered_df = df[(df['date_column'] >= start_date) & (df['date_column'] <= end_date)]\n"

    "# Q6. What is the definition of a 180-day moving average?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A 180-day moving average is a technical indicator used in financial analysis and charting. It is calculated by \n",
    "    taking the average of a stocks closing prices over the most recent 180 trading days.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Q7. Did the chapter's final example use \"indirect\" importing? If so, how exactly do you do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \"Indirect\" importing is typically used when you want to import a module or function using a variable or string \n",
    "    containing the modules name. This is often done dynamically based on user input or configuration."
