    "# Q1. What are the two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. As of my knowledge cutoff date in January 2022, there were no specific \"latest\" user-defined exception constraints in\n",
    "Python 3.X. User-defined exceptions in Python can be created by defining custom exception classes that inherit from the \n",
    "built-in BaseException class or one of its subclasses (e.g., Exception). You can add your own attributes and behaviors to\n",
    "these custom exception classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Pythons development continues, and new features and constraints may have been introduced in later versions of \n",
    "Python after my last training data. I recommend checking the Python documentation or release notes for the most up-to-date\n",
    "information on user-defined exceptions in the version of Python you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?\n",
    "\n",
    "A2. In Python, class-based exceptions are raised using the raise statement and can be caught and handled using try and \n",
    "except blocks. When an exception is raised, Python searches for an except block that can handle the exception based on \n",
    "the following matching process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python checks each except block in the order they appear in the code.\n",
    "It compares the type of the raised exception (the class of the exception) with the types specified in each except block.\n",
    "If there is a match (either the exception type or one of its base classes matches), the corresponding except block is executed.\n",
    "If no match is found, the exception propagates to the outer enclosing try statement or, if not caught there, terminates \n",
    "the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "A3. Attaching context information to exception artifacts can be useful for providing additional information about the\n",
    "error. Two common methods to do this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Arguments: When creating a custom exception or raising a built-in exception, you can pass additional arguments\n",
    "to the exceptions constructor to provide context information. These arguments can be accessed later when handling the \n",
    "exception\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Attributes: You can define custom attributes on your exception classes to store context information. These\n",
    "attributes can be accessed within the exception handler. \n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4. Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception objects error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "A4. You can specify the text of an exception objects error message in various ways, \n",
    "\n",
    "Custom __str__ Method You can override the __str__ method in your custom exception class to provide a custom \n",
    "error message. This method is called when you use str(exception) to obtain the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing a String as the Exception Argument: When raising an exception, you can pass a string as the exception argument,\n",
    "which serves as the error message. This message can be accessed using the str() function or by catching the exception and\n",
    "accessing str(exception).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "A5. In modern Python programming, string-based exceptions are discouraged and no longer recommended for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarity and Type Safety: String-based exceptions dont provide clear information about the type of error being raised.\n",
    "Using class-based exceptions allows you to define specific exception types that convey the nature of the error, making your code more self-explanatory and type-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Handling: Class-based exceptions support structured exception handling with try and except blocks. \n",
    "You can catch specific exceptions and handle them differently, which is not possible with string-based exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: Class-based exceptions follow a consistent and well-documented convention, making it easier for developers to \n",
    "understand and work with exceptions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: You can add custom attributes and behaviors to class-based exceptions, providing more flexibility in how you\n",
    "handle and report errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Message Customization: Class-based exceptions allow you to customize error messages using methods like __str__, \n",
    "providing more control over the error message format and content."
