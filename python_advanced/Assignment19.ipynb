    "#Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The relationship between a class and its instances is a one-to-many partnership. A class serves as a blueprint or\n",
    "    template for creating multiple instances, and each instance can have its own unique state and behavior while adhering \n",
    "    to the class's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2. What kind of data is held only in an instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Data held only in an instance is typically instance-specific data, which includes attributes or variables that are \n",
    "    unique to each instance of the class. These attributes store the state or characteristics of a particular instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3. What kind of knowledge is stored in a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Knowledge stored in a class includes class-specific data and methods. Class variables store data shared among all \n",
    "    instances of the class, and class methods define behavior or operations that are common to all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4. What exactly is a method, and how is it different from a regular function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A method is a function that is associated with a class. The key difference between a method and a regular function\n",
    "    is that a method is defined within a class and operates on class instances. Methods can access and modify \n",
    "    instance-specific data, whereas regular functions are standalone and do not have access to instance data unless it is\n",
    "    passed as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q5. Is inheritance supported in Python, and if so, what is the syntax?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Yes, inheritance is supported in Python. Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. \n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    # ChildClass inherits from ParentClass\n",
    "    # Define additional attributes and methods specific to ChildClass\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Python supports encapsulation to a certain extent through naming conventions. Variables or methods can be made \n",
    "    \"private\" by prefixing their names with a single underscore (e.g., _my_variable). However, this is a convention, and \n",
    "    it does not provide true access control. Its a signal to other developers that a variable or method is intended for\n",
    "    internal use, but it can still be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q7. How do you distinguish between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are defined within the class but outside any methods.\n",
    "    Instance variables are specific to each instance and are defined within methods or the class __init__ constructor. \n",
    "    You can access class variables using the class name (e.g., ClassName.class_variable) and instance variables using an\n",
    "    instance of the class (e.g., instance.instance_variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q8. When, if ever, can self be included in a class's method definitions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: self should be included as the first parameter in a class method definitions. It represents the instance that the\n",
    "    method is operating on and allows you to access instance-specific data and methods within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q9. What is the difference between the __add__ and the __radd__ methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The __add__ method is used to define the behavior of the addition operator (+) when the object is on the left side\n",
    "    of the operator. The __radd__ method is used to define the behavior of the addition operator when the object is on the\n",
    "    right side of the operator. These methods allow you to customize how objects of your class interact with the addition \n",
    "    operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q10. When is it necessary to use a reflection method? When do you not need it, even though you support the operation in question?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A reflection method, such as __str__ or __repr__, is necessary when you want to provide a custom string \n",
    "    representation of an object. You dont need it if the default string representation is sufficient for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q11. What is the __iadd__ method called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The __iadd__ method is called when the in-place addition operator (+=) is used on an object. It allows you to\n",
    "    define the behavior of the += operator for instances of your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q12. Is the __init__ method inherited by subclasses? What do you do if you need to customize its behavior within a subclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The __init__ method is not automatically inherited by subclasses, but a subclass can choose to override it.\n",
    "    To customize the behavior of __init__ within a subclass, you can define a new __init__ method in the subclass, and\n",
    "    it should call the superclass's __init__ method if you want to retain the superclass's behavior while adding or \n",
    "    modifying functionality in the subclass's constructor."
